            As a team, we’ve spent years building online communities and we’ve
            seen how valuable they can be to businesses when managed well. But
            that’s a full-time job, and a lot of businesses don’t have the
            access or the budget to hire experienced, full-time community
            managers.

            There are a lot of hard problems to solve when you’re starting a
            community from scratch, but now you don’t have to face these
            problems alone.
